  * Close the gap between homework and exam performance with Warren/Reeve/Duchac's ACCOUNTING 26E and CNOWv2! Market-leading ACCOUNTING has been on the forefront of innovation and change based on the needs of today's teaching and learning environment. Warren/Reeve/Duchac's ACCOUNTING 26E, now available as a bundle option with CNOWv2 helps elevate student thinking with content that addresses each stage of the learning process from motivation to mastery. This integrated system motivates students to learn, provides practice opportunities to better prepare for exams, and helps students achieve mastery with tools to help them make connections and see the big picture. The Complete Learning System in ACCOUNTING and CNOWv2 is built around the way students use textbooks and online resources to learn, study and complete homework, allowing them to achieve ultimate success in this course. New content includes author-written Dynamic Exhibits that allow students to see connections and relationships like never before! Dynamic Exhibits allow students to change the variables in a scenario and see how a change ripples through the accounting system, helping students understand how concepts relate to one another. In addition to the many new digital assets created for this edition, the textbook content itself has also been revised to include the new revenue recognition standard and a greater emphasis on service companies in the managerial accounting chapters. The end goal of Warren/Reeve/Duchac's ACCOUNTING and CNOWv2 is to elevate thinking and create more empowered and prepared students--ready to take on the rest of their educational and career goals.
